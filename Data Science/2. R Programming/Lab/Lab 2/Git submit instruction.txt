Did you first commit the code to your local repository?

pwd (print working directory)
cd ...../Tuan/Documents/GitHub
git clone [url]

Here are the typical steps you have to follow for git.
git add cachematrix.R                      # Stage the file for commit 
git add -A 				   # Add all file
git commit -m "Submitting assignment 2"    # Commit the file to the local repo with some comment
git push                                   # Push the commit to github

Here are some other git commands which might be helpful.
git status     # Shows the modified files (in this case cachematrix.R)

git diff       # Shows you changes which can be viewed before committing.
